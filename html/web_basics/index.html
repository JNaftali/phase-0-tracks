  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>I'm glad you could join me to talk about <strong>cats!</strong></p>
  <p>Cats are very important creatures. The most in the world really. Just ask <em>any one of them - they should know!</em> And here's why!</p>
  <ul><li>They're furry.</li><li>They're cute.</li><li>'Nuff said!</li></ul>
  <p>When dealing with cats there are 3 things you should never, never forget:</p>
  <ol><li>The first...</li><li>The second...</li><li>And, of course, the third!</li></ol>
  <p>Finally, if you want to learn more about cats you can read about them on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cats">Wikipedia</a>, or anywhere else on the internet!  Ciao!</p>
