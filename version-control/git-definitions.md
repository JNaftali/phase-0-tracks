# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* Version control is a way to work on a file without having to start from scratch if you make a stupid change and break it.
* A branch is a copy of the code that you can work on without it affecting the bulk of the code until you're sure you got it right.
* A commit tells git that you want to put the changed version of the file back into the repository.
* A merge conflict is when you attempt to merge one branch into another, but both branches have made changes to certain lines of certain files since the last time they merged.

Poop. Just poop.
