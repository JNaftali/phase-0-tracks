# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control allows people to view the history of revisions to one or more files made by different people. Version control might include a timeline of date, timestamp, and the user(s) that edited. It's beneficial because if someone makes a mistake, we can revisit a previous edit.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is an edited version of an original copy of code. It is useful to allow different users to branch off from the original version to add their own edits.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a saving point with a unique string of random numbers and letters, an author, and a timestamp. A good commit message includes a summary of what was done.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict arises when your current branch and the branch your want to merge diverge. For instance, you might have commits in your current branch that are not in the other branch, or vice versa.
