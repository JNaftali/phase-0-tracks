# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?** Version control allows us to view all the revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by other people. It's useful because if someone made a mistake they would just be able to go back to an earlier version or even if you didn't like the revisions made you could just revert back to an earlier version.
* **What is a branch and why would you use one?** A branch is a copy of the master. You would use a branch because it allows you to work in there without affecting the master. 
* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?** A commit is a save point. It records your changes made to the repository. A good commit message is detailed and states what has been changed.
* **What is a merge conflict?** A merge conflict is when two branches have changes in the same part of the same file and then those branch are merged together creating a conflict.
