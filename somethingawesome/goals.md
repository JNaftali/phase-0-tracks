# Project Goal #

#### Note: goals are in order of priority. I reserve the right to declare victory even if not all goals are complete. Wherever possible I'll design code to make integrating these features in the future easy.

Grocery/fridge tracker
1.Maintain (via user input) list of groceries in the fridge - done
  Stretch goal: allow for smart fridge integration (do people use those? Are there APIs?)
2.Allow users to keep a list of what should be kept in the fridge at all times
3.Plan shopping trips - generate a list of what should be bought based on what is on hand and what is wanted (and add to it)
4.Support multiple users and let each request things from the next shopping trip, and mark items as "reserved"
5.Schedule meals and ingredients required to make them, to be automatically added to shopping trips

Technical todo
1. Allow specifying a purchase date when adding an item to the fridge
